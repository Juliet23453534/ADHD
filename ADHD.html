    <h1><u>Signs</u> and<u>Symptoms</u></h1>
    <p>It is normal for children to have trouble focusing and behaving at one time or another. However, children with ADHD do not just grow out of these behaviors. The symptoms continue, can be severe, and can cause difficulty at school, at home, or with friends.</p>

    <h2>A child with ADHD might:</h2>
    <ul style="color: seagreen;">
        <li>daydream a lot</li>
        <li>forget or lose things a lot</li>
        <li>squirm or fidget</li>
        <li>talk too much</li>
        <li>make careless mistakes or take unnecessary risks</li>
        <li>have a hard time resisting temptation</li>
        <li>have trouble taking turns</li>
        <li>have difficulty getting along with others</li>
    </ul>
    <h1>Types</h1>
    <p><span class="para1">There are three different ways ADHD presents itself, depending on which types of symptoms are strongest in the individual:</span></p>
    <h2>Predominantly Inattentive Presentation:</h2>
    <p><span class="para2">It is hard for the individual to organize or finish a task, to pay attention to details, or to follow instructions or conversations. The person is easily distracted or forgets details of daily routines.</span></p>
    <h2>Predominantly Hyperactive-Impulsive Presentation:</h2>
    <p class="para3">The person fidgets and talks a lot. It is hard to sit still for long (e.g., for a meal or while doing homework). Smaller children may run, jump or climb constantly. The individual feels restless and has trouble with impulsivity. Someone who is impulsive may interrupt others a lot, grab things from people, or speak at inappropriate times. It is hard for the person to wait their turn or listen to directions. A person with impulsiveness may have more accidents and injuries than others.</p>

    </div>
    <h2>Combined Presentation:</h2>
    <p><span class="para4">Symptoms of the above two types are equally present in the person.</span></p>
    <h1>Diagnosis</h1>
    <p>Deciding if a child has ADHD is a process with several steps. There is no single test to diagnose ADHD, and many other problems, like anxiety, depression, sleep problems, and certain types of learning disabilities, can have similar symptoms. One step of the process involves having a medical exam, including hearing and vision tests, to rule out other problems with symptoms like ADHD. Diagnosing ADHD usually includes a checklist for rating ADHD symptoms and taking a history of the child from parents, teachers, and sometimes, the child.</p>
    <h1>Treatments</h1>
    <p>In most cases, ADHD is best treated with a combination of behavior therapy and medication. For preschool-aged children (4-5 years of age) with ADHD, behavior therapy, particularly training for parents, is recommended as the first line of treatment before medication is tried. What works best can depend on the child and family. Good treatment plans will include close monitoring, follow-ups, and making changes, if needed, along the way.</p>
